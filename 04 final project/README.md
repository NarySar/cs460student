# Brick Breaker Game:

What is Brick Breaker is a Breakout clone in which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the BlackBerry's trackwheel, the computer's mouse or the touch of a finger (in the case of touchscreen). The player gets three lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new, harder level. There are 34 levels. Many levels have unbreakable silver bricks. If all lives are lost, the game is over. There are many versions of Brick Breaker, some in which players can shoot flaming fireballs or play with more than one ball if the player gets a power up.

## History of Brick Breaker - What is Brick Breaker?

## The history of Brick Breaker Game:

Breakout is an arcade video game developed and published by Atari, Inc.[7] and released on May 13, 1976.[2] It was designed by Steve Wozniak, based on conceptualization from Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, who were influenced by the seminal 1972 Atari arcade game Pong. In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all by repeatedly bouncing a ball off a paddle into them.

```

### How to play the game:

Use the left and right arrow keys to pilot your paddle
in order to bounce the ball against the bricks (Press up arrow for a secret cheat). When all the bricks are broken, you clear the level. When all levels are cleared, you win the game.

After winning the game, you can press a key to continue on to new game+;

If the ball passes the paddle 5 times, then you lose the game but cant play again immediately. However, this will reset your score and new game+ progress.

The game keeps track of the level, player score and lives left.
